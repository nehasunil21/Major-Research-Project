## Overview

The aim of this study is to train different classifier models that can help classify whether the tumor in the breast is benign or malignant and help predict the reoccurrence of cases classified as malignant by observing the most important features. To identify the best trained classifier, 7 different algorithms were applied and their statistic results were analyzed to determine the appropriate approach for this analysis. 

Helping women with early diagnosis of breast cancer could lower the risk of prolonged treatment and sometimes death. Since early-stage breast cancer is easier to treat considering the tumor isnâ€™t too large and has not spread, it is important that we develop a more efficient, accurate and reliable approach to do so. This can be achieved by dint of machine learning classifiers.

## Dataset Description

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, available on the UCI Machine Learning repository defines features that were computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirant (FNA) of a breast mass. These features report the characteristics of the cell nuclei from the image. Breast mass FNA is considered to play a key role in assessing malignancy in breast cell tissue. This dataset was put together by Dr. William H. Wolberg while he was at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Hospital. This dataset comprises of 569 samples of breast cell tissue which were medically assessed focusing on 32 characteristics of the cell nucleus.
